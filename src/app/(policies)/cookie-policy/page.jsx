          <h2>Do Not Track (DNT) Signals</h2>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; is a browser feature that allows users to
            opt out of website tracking, including analytics and advertising.
            While DNT is a user preference, its effectiveness depends on website
            responses.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Approach to DNT Signals</h2>
          <p>
            Spectrum Consults respects DNT signals and limits data collection
            accordingly. When we detect a DNT signal from your browser, we
            adjust our data collection practices as described in our Privacy
            Policy. However, please note that enabling DNT may affect the
            functionality and personalization of some parts of our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential to review individual website policies and services
            for their response to DNT signals, as third-party services may have
            different policies.
